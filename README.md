# Module 1 Project

I set out to find and scrape relevent data regarding successful movies at the box office.

My questions were:

To study the impact that the popularity of an actor/actress has on the box office results of a film.

To study the impact that the popularity of the top directors have on a film at the box office.

To study the relation between production budget, return on investment and box office success to find a “sweet spot” for the production budget.
